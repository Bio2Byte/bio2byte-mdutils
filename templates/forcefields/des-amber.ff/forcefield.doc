DES_Amber         

***************************************************************************
*  This is a conversion of the DES-Amber force-field from Desmond         *
*  DES-Amber has charges an ions that are scaled by a factor of 0.9       *
*  This means if you are combining thisforce fields with lipids or        *
*  ligands with  charges, the total charge of the system will not be equal*
*  charges, the total charge of the system will not be equal              *
*  You can either scale the charges of the other molecules, or use        *
*  DES-amber_SF1.0 (scale factor 1.0) which does not scale charges        *
*  For DES-Amber cite:                                                    *
